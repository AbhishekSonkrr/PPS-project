# Project file map and responsibilities

This document lists the important files and folders in the repository and briefly explains what each one does ("inka kya kaam hai"). It also includes quick build/run commands and suggested cleanup steps.

---

## Checklist

- [x] Describe top-level build files and scripts
- [x] Describe `include/` and every `src/*.c`
- [x] Describe generated/build artifacts and `archive/`
- [x] Provide copy-paste build & run commands
- [x] Provide recommended housekeeping actions

---

## Top-level files

- `CMakeLists.txt`  
  Kaam: CMake configuration. Defines the project, C standard, include dir, and an explicit list of executable targets (e.g. `bubbleSort`, `straightInsertionSort`). Use this to build with CMake/CLion.

- `Makefile`  
  Kaam: Simple `make` build rules for each sorter executable. Useful if you want a quick `make` without CMake.

- `run_all.sh`  
  Kaam: Helper script that runs a CMake build and executes each sorter binary, then checks that the printed "Sorted ... Array" lines are non-decreasing (basic smoke tests).

- `README.md`  
  Kaam: Project documentation, build instructions, CLion tips, and a short description of how `sort_main.h` provides a unified `main()`.

- `FILES_EXPLAINED.md`  
  Kaam: (This file) Per-file explanations and quick usage notes.

---

## Shared header

- `include/sort_main.h`  
  Kaam: The unified test harness. It provides:
  - `main()` which prints arrays, calls the sorting function (macro `SORT_FUNC`), and measures timing.
  - helpers: `printArray`, `generateRandomArray`, `sortAndTime`.

  Pattern: each `src/*.c` does `#define SIZE` and `#define SORT_FUNC <function>` and then `#include "sort_main.h"`.

---

## Source files (`src/`)

Each `src/*.c` implements one sorting algorithm and uses `sort_main.h` to get a standard `main()` and test harness.

- `src/bubbleSort.c`  
  Kaam: Implements `void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)`. When built it becomes the `bubbleSort` executable.

- `src/heapsort.c`  
  Kaam: Implements heap sort (`heapify` + `heapSort`) exposed as `heapSort`.

- `src/quickSort.c`  
  Kaam: Implements quicksort (partition + recursive quickSort) and exposes a wrapper used by the harness (e.g., `quickSortWrapper` or `quickSort`).

- `src/selectionSort.c`  
  Kaam: Implements `selectionSort`.

- `src/shellSort.c`  
  Kaam: Implements shell sort; note the function name inside may be `shell_sort` while the executable is `shellSort`.

- `src/straightInsertionSort.c`  
  Kaam: Correctly-spelled insertion sort implementation (authoritative insertion sort source).

> Note: the previously misspelled `straightInstertionSort.c` was archived (moved to `archive/old/`) and then removed from `src/` to avoid confusion.

---

## Archive, miscellaneous, and helper files

- `archive/`  
  Kaam: Legacy files and older versions. For example `archive/old/straightInstertionSort.c` contains the original misspelled/legacy copy kept for reference.

- `patter-not-in-project.c`  
  Kaam: A stray/test C file — not part of the main build.

- `compile_commands.json`  
  Kaam: Compilation database generated by CMake. Useful for language servers (clangd) and editor tooling. This is generated and can be re-generated by running CMake.

---

## Build directories, IDE files and generated binaries

- `build/` and `cmake-build-debug/`  
  Kaam: Generated CMake build directories. Contain intermediate files, object files, and executables. Safe to delete and re-create using CMake.

- Top-level binaries (e.g., `bubbleSort`, `heapsort`, `shellSort`)  
  Kaam: Executables produced by `make` or CMake. Should be ignored in git (`.gitignore`) if you want a clean repository.

- `.idea/`, `.vscode/`  
  Kaam: IDE/editor config — usually user-specific. Add to `.gitignore` unless you want to share them.

---

## What each executable does (quick)

Each produced executable (e.g., `bubbleSort`, `straightInsertionSort`) will:
1. Prepare three arrays: an ordered array, a reverse-ordered array, and a random array.
2. Print the original arrays.
3. Call the sorting function implemented in its corresponding `src/*.c`.
4. Print the sorted arrays.
5. Run a timing harness (repeat sorting many times) and print average execution time (approximate, nanoseconds).

This behavior comes from `include/sort_main.h`.

---

## Quick build & test commands

Use these commands in the repository root.

CMake (recommended):

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
cd ..
```

Make:

```bash
make clean
make -j$(nproc)
```

Run smoke tests (runs build then executes each sorter):

```bash
./run_all.sh
```

---

## Recommended housekeeping (I can run these automatically)

- Add `.gitignore` entries for:
  - `build/`
  - `cmake-build-debug/`
  - compiled binaries (e.g., `bubbleSort`, `heapsort`, ...)
  - `compile_commands.json`

- Keep `archive/` if you want historical copies, or move it to another branch if you prefer a slim `main` branch.

- Add a CI workflow (GitHub Actions) that runs `./run_all.sh` on push/PR so builds and basic smoke tests are validated automatically.

- Standardize function naming (optional): ensure function names and target names match a consistent naming convention (e.g., `camelCase` for both).

---

If you want, I can now:

- add a `.gitignore` with the recommended entries, and commit it;
- add a small GitHub Actions workflow that runs `./run_all.sh` on each push/PR;
- remove `archive/old/` (permanent deletion) if you no longer need legacy files.

Tell me which one to do or I can implement all of them automatically.
